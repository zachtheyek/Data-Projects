This repo contains various data projects I'm working on as part of my data science interview prep; all datasets & questions courtesy of [StrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/data-projects) unless otherwise stated.

# Navigation
- Each directory represents a unique data project, where the company and project start date (in the format: dd_mm_yy) are listed in the directory's name.
- Datasets are housed inside their relevant directories, in the form of a `.csv` file.
- The solution to each project is also contained inside their corresponding directories, in the form of a `.ipynb` file.
